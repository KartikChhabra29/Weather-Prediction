Weather Prediction Web Application
This is a simple and responsive weather prediction web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app leverages a reliable weather API to fetch real-time weather data for any specified location, providing users with current conditions and forecasts.

Features
Fetches live weather data from a trusted public API.
Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
User-friendly interface with clean and intuitive design using CSS.

Responsive layout ensuring compatibility across devices.
Easy-to-use search functionality to check weather in different cities.

Technologies Used
HTML for the structural layout of the web pages.
CSS for styling and responsive design.
JavaScript for dynamic data fetching and content rendering.
Weather API integration to access accurate and updated weather information.

How It Works
The app takes a city name as input from the user, sends a request to the weather API, retrieves the weather data, and dynamically updates the webpage to display the relevant weather details.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for learning web development concepts like API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive design.
